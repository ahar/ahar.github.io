I am currenetly working as a Technical Lead in Novus Hi-Tech Robotic Systems LTD. I work on multi-modal sensory perception for autonomous mobile robots. For the past approximately two and a half years I have been working on Mapping and Localization for mobile robots deployed in large warehouse and manufacturing sites. 

Prior to joing at [NHRSL](https://novushitech.com/), I completed my PhD from IITB-Monash Research Academy, through a joint Doctoral program offered by [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) and [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/). For latest research publication update, please visit [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=PTq-MC0AAAAJ&hl=en). Please check my [GitHub](https://github.com/ahar) for latest software commit/releases.
